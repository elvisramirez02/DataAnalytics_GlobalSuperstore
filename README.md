üåü Global Superstore Sales Dashboard üåü
Welcome to the Global Superstore Sales Dashboard project! This dashboard provides deep insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior using the Global Superstore dataset. Created using Power BI, this project employs advanced analytics to drive business decisions.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Global Superstore dataset, which includes comprehensive details on sales, customers, products, and geographical regions.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand the data structure and uncover initial insights:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics to understand data central tendency and dispersion.
Visualization: Initial charts to explore relationships and trends.
üîß Feature Engineering
Feature engineering created new variables to enhance predictive power:

Year-Month: Combining year and month for monthly trend analysis.
Sales Category: Categorizing sales into High, Medium, and Low.
Customer Segment: Segmenting customers based on purchase behavior.
‚≠ê Data Modeling - Star Schema
A star schema was designed to optimize query performance and simplify reporting:

Fact Table: Central table with quantitative data (e.g., sales, profit).
Dimension Tables: Supporting tables with descriptive attributes (e.g., customers, products, regions).
